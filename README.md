# Banking-program-using-CPP
This is a simple program to track how the transactions in a basic banking system take place. The code is written in CPP and does not require any external resources. 
In order to access the code just clone and run the code on any CPP coumpiler. I have specifically used the Turbo C++ compiler for developing this project.
